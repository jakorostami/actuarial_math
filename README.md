# My own attempt to do actuarial mathematics is concentrated in this repo.


Since statistics and probability theory is heavily used in actuarial mathematics, my background in stats & prob should atleast give me some good understanding of actuarial mathematics. 

Therefore, this repo is intended to demonstrate that a Statistician can work with Actuaries and understand their work :)
